# Balaban_Index
To calculate Balaban Index of all acyclic molecules from Smiles Notation in c++ languages

Balaban Index is a topological index like Wiener Index.
It is used as descriptor for molecules in QSAR studies and for machine learning program
In this program, I had calculated it by reading smile notation of a molecule with conditions like if it gets bracket then it has to do
these things. Likewise, I have calculated the Wiener index for the acyclic compound.

Future Plan:
1. We can make it workable for cyclic one also.
